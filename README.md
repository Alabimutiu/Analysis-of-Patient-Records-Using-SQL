# Analysis-of-Patient-Records-Using-SQL


This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze health data, focusing on patient demographics, disease diagnoses, treatment outcomes, and hospital utilization metrics.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains records of 200 patients, including the following fields:

- **PatientID**: Unique identifier  
- **Age**: Patient's age  
- **Gender**: Male/Female  
- **Diagnosis**: Type of disease (e.g., Diabetes, Cancer)  
- **Admission_Date** and **Discharge_Date**  
- **TreatmentOutcome**: Recovered, Referred, Deceased  
- **Hospital_Stay_Days**  
- **Region**: Geographic location  

## 🛠 SQL Tasks

This project covers the following types of SQL analysis:

- Patient demographics and age group distribution  
- Disease frequency and outcomes  
- Regional performance comparisons  
- Admission and discharge trends  
- Hospital utilization metrics  

## 📊 Key Queries

The `biostatistics_sql_queries.sql` file contains:

1. Total number of patients  
2. Gender-based distribution  
3. Age group analysis  
4. Top diagnoses  
5. Regional distributions  
6. Average hospital stays  
7. Monthly admissions  
8. Mortality and recovery rates  
9. Top outcomes  
10. Insights into longest stays and oldest patients  

## 💡 How to Use

1. Load the CSV dataset into a SQL-compatible environment (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).  
2. Run the queries from the provided `.sql` file.  
3. Explore insights and visualize them using BI tools if needed.  

## 📂 Files
